# Tech For Social Impact - Chat Copilot

Created through collaboration between Microsoft's Tech for Social Impact team, Aware and non-profit customers, this template offers a ready-to-launch chat feature aimed at non-profit organizations.

The code is based on the [microsoft/chat-copilot](https://github.com/microsoft/chat-copilot) project. Additions have been made to support custom theming through Azure App Settings, managed identity for as many services as possible, repeatable single package deployment and all new bicep templates that require minimal setup/config.
